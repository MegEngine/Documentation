msgid "前面提到了量化就是将基于浮点数据类型的模型转换为定点数进行运算，其核心就是如何用定点数去表示模型中的浮点数，以及如何用定点运算去表示对应的浮点运算。 以float32转uint8为例，一种最简单的转换方法是直接舍去float32的小数部分，只取其中的整数部分，并且对于超出(0,255)表示范围的值用0或者255表示。 这种方案显然是不合适的，尤其是深度神经网络经过bn处理后，其中间层输出基本都是0均值，1方差的数据范围，在这种方案下因为小数部分被舍弃掉了，会带来大量的 精度损失。并且因为(0,255)以外的部分被clip到了0或255，当浮点数为负或者大于255的情况下，会导致巨大的误差。"
msgstr "As mentioned earlier, quantization is to convert models based on floating-point data types into fixed-point numbers for operations. The core is how to use fixed-point numbers to represent floating-point numbers in the model, and how to use fixed-point operations to represent corresponding floating-point operations. Taking float32 to uint8 as an example, one of the simplest conversion methods is to directly discard the decimal part of float32, only take the integer part, and use 0 or 255 for the value beyond the range of (0,255). This scheme is obviously inappropriate, especially after the deep neural network is processed by bn, the output of the middle layer is basically a data range of 0 mean and 1 variance. Under this scheme, because the decimal part is discarded, it will bring Comes a lot of accuracy loss. And because the parts other than (0,255) are clipped to 0 or 255, when the floating point number is negative or greater than 255, it will cause huge errors."

msgid "这个方案比较接近我们常见编程语言中的类型转换逻辑，我们可以把它称之为类型转换方案。上面的分析可以看出，类型转换方案对于过大或者过小的数据都会产生较大的精度损失。"
msgstr "This scheme is closer to the type conversion logic in our common programming languages, and we can call it a type conversion scheme. From the above analysis, it can be seen that the type conversion scheme will produce a large loss of accuracy for data that is too large or too small."

msgid "目前主流的浮点转定点方案基本采用均匀量化，因为这种方案对推理更友好。将一个浮点数根据其值域范围，均匀的映射到一个定点数的表达范围上。"

msgid "由上可以看出均匀量化方案对于任意的值域范围都能表达相对不错的性能，不会存在类型转换方案的过小值域丢精度和过大值域无法表示的情况。 代价是需要额外引入零点$z$和值域$s$两个变量。同时我们可以看出，均匀量化方案因为$round$和$clamp$操作也是存在精度损失的，所以会对模型的性能产生影响。 如何减轻数据从浮点转换到定点的精度损失，是整个量化研究的重点。"
msgstr "From the above, it can be seen that the uniform quantization scheme can express relatively good performance for any range of values, and there will be no case that the type conversion scheme loses accuracy in the small value range and cannot be represented by the large value range. The cost is that two additional variables,$z$and range$s$At the same time, we can see that the uniform quantization scheme$round$and$clamp$operations, so it will have an impact on the performance of the model. How to reduce the precision loss of data conversion from floating point to fixed point is the focus of the entire quantification research."

msgid "``注意零点很重要，因为我们的网络模型的padding，relu等运算对于0比较敏感，需要被正确量化才能保证转换后的定点运算的正确性。当浮点数的值域范围不包含零点的时候，为了保证正确量化，我们需要对其值域范围进行一定程度的缩放使其可以包含0点``"
msgstr "``It is important to pay attention to the zero point, because the padding, relu and other operations of our network model are more sensitive to 0 and need to be quantified correctly to ensure the correctness of the converted fixed-point operation. When the value range of the floating-point number does not contain the zero point, in order to ensure the correct quantization, we need to scale the value range to a certain extent so that it can include 0 points."

msgstr "Therefore, the floating-point number after quantization and dequantization has a certain error with the original floating-point number. The difference in this process can be seen in the figure below. Quantization discretizes the parameters of our network model. The degree of influence of this operation on the final number of points of the model depends on the difference between the parameter distribution of our model itself and the uniform distribution.

It is not difficult to find that the above values may overflow if and only if a, b, c, d are all -128. As long as this situation is avoided, there will be no overflow problem. Since there must be two values in a, b, c, and d as weight, our traditional approach is to define the quantization range of weight as [-127, 127]"

msgstr "In the section of uniform quantization, we mentioned that the error before and after quantization mainly depends on the model parameters and the difference between the activation value distribution and the uniform distribution. For a quantitatively friendly model, we only need to obtain the range of its range through range statistics, and then call the corresponding quantization scheme to fix it.
