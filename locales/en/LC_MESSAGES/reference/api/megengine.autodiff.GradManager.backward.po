msgid ":meth:`backward` computes the vector-Jacobian product :math:`dx_j = \\sum_{i} dy_i J_{ij}` where :math:`J_{ij} = ∂y_i/∂x_j` is the Jacobian matrix between vector variables :math:`y` and :math:`x`, with all vectors involved represented as a list of tensors, in the sense of direct sums (or flatten-and-concatenate). :math:`y` and :math:`dy` are passed as the first and second parameter respectively, whereas :math:`x` is directly taken from the list of all attached tensors. The result :math:`dx` is also not returned. Instead, it is directly accumulated into the .grad attribute of matching attached tensors (a.k.a. :math:`x`). This can be done unambiguously since :math:`dx` as a list of tensors has the same structure as :math:`x`."

msgid "If :math:`y` is a scalar and :math:`dy` is chosen to be 1, the vector-Jacobian product yield gradient of :math:`y` with repect to :math:`x` as a special case. In that case, you will be able to omit the :math:`dy` parameter and :meth:`backward` will automatically use 1 for it and compute the gradient."
