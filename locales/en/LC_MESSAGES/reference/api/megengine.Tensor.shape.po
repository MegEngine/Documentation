"The shape of a tensor was usually represented by a :class:`tuple`. But if"
" a tensor was treated as symbolic placeholder with tracing, it's shape "

"The shape property is usually used to get the current shape of a tensor, "
"but may also be used to reshape the tensor in-place by assigning a tuple "
"of tensor dimensions to it. As with :func:`~.reshape`, one of the new "
"shape dimensions can be -1, in which case its value is inferred from the "
"size of the tensor and the remaining dimensions."
