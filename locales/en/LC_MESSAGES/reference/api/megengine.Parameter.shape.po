#: megengine.Parameter.shape:5 of
msgid "The shape of a tensor was usually represented by a :class:`tuple`. But if a tensor was treated as symbolic placeholder with tracing, it's shape could also be a :class:`~.Tensor`. See :class:`~.trace` for more details."

#: megengine.Parameter.shape:9 of
msgid "The shape property is usually used to get the current shape of a tensor, but may also be used to reshape the tensor in-place by assigning a tuple of tensor dimensions to it. As with :func:`~.reshape`, one of the new shape dimensions can be -1, in which case its value is inferred from the size of the tensor and the remaining dimensions."
