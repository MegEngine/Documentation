"Reverse mode autodiff normally reuses many intermediate tensors for best "
"computation efficiency. In a read-eval-print-loop (REPL) environment "
"however, it is impossible to known how the user would take gradients "
"later thus which tensors to keep. To solve this problem, the user must "
"somehow declare beforehand which gradient could possibly be taken. With "
"GradManager, users are required to call the :meth:`attach` method on a "
"tensor if they want to take gradients with respect to it later. "
"Furthermore, any computation on a tensor before it is attached is "
"completely ignored from the autodiff perspective, so :meth:`attach` must "
"be called before any computation that needs differentiation."

"For your convenience, GradManager may (not must) be reused. As shown in "
"the examples, you only need to attach a tensor once and GradManager will "
"remember it afterwards. However, a single GradManager can record only one"
" computation history at a time. To run multiple differentiations "
"simultaneously or perform high order differentiation, create as many "
"GradManager as you need."

"Mutable tensors introduce ambiguities when doing symbolic "
"differentiation: which version of the tensor are we referring to? For "
"attached tensors, GradManager resolves this ambiguity by \"snapshoting\" "
"them on first encounter, either on :meth:`record` (or entering with "
"statement) if tensor is attached before :meth:`record`, or on "
":meth:`attach` if GradManager is already recording. Attached tensors will"
" then be interpreted as their snapshotted version for differentiation "
"purpose. The same ambiguity on the first parameter of :meth:`backward` is"
" simply resolved by using the latest version."
