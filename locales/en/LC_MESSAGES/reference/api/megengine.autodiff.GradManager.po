#: megengine.autodiff.grad_manager.GradManager:4 of
msgid "Reverse mode autodiff normally reuses many intermediate tensors for best computation efficiency. In a read-eval-print-loop (REPL) environment however, it is impossible to known how the user would take gradients later thus which tensors to keep. To solve this problem, the user must somehow declare beforehand which gradient could possibly be taken. With GradManager, users are required to call the :meth:`attach` method on a tensor if they want to take gradients with respect to it later. Furthermore, any computation on a tensor before it is attached is completely ignored from the autodiff perspective, so :meth:`attach` must be called before any computation that needs differentiation."

#: megengine.autodiff.grad_manager.GradManager:62 of
msgid "For your convenience, GradManager may (not must) be reused. As shown in the examples, you only need to attach a tensor once and GradManager will remember it afterwards. However, a single GradManager can record only one computation history at a time. To run multiple differentiations simultaneously or perform high order differentiation, create as many GradManager as you need."
msgstr ""

#: megengine.autodiff.grad_manager.GradManager:70 of
msgid "Mutable tensors introduce ambiguities when doing symbolic differentiation: which version of the tensor are we referring to? For attached tensors, GradManager resolves this ambiguity by \"snapshoting\" them on first encounter, either on :meth:`record` (or entering with statement) if tensor is attached before :meth:`record`, or on :meth:`attach` if GradManager is already recording. Attached tensors will then be interpreted as their snapshotted version for differentiation purpose. The same ambiguity on the first parameter of :meth:`backward` is simply resolved by using the latest version."

msgid "The effect of :meth:`attach` will persist across multiple uses of the GradManager. When reusing a GradManager, it is likely a mistake to call :meth:`attach` on the same set of tensors and callbacks repeatedly, which may grow the callback list indefinitely."
msgstr ""

#: megengine.autodiff.grad_manager.GradManager.attach:36 of
msgid "When reusing a GradManager, it is sometimes desirable to attach temporary tensors each time, e.g. for computing gradients of inputs of a neural network. GradManager tries to accommodate such usages by holding weak references to attached tensors. Most of the times, this should be enough to prevent resource leak. Unfortunately, there are still some pitfalls left:"
msgstr ""

#: megengine.autodiff.grad_manager.GradManager.attach:42 of
msgid "Callbacks should not hold strong references, directly or indirectly, to attached tensors. Any strong reference, including those from callbacks, will prevent garbage collection (even by the cycle collector!) of a attached tensor, until the GradManager object is garbage collected."

msgid "Please also note that GradManager might hold additional strong references to attached tensors when it is in use. This note only covers potential resource leaks across multiple uses of a GradManager, which is unrelated to whether resources is timely released within a single use."

The result :math:`dx` is also not returned. Instead, it is directly accumulated into the .grad attribute of matching attached tensors (a.k.a. :math:`x`).
